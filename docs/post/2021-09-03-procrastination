What is procrastination to begin with? Procrastination is the action of unnecessarily and voluntarily delaying or postponing something despite knowing that there will be negative consequences for doing so (wiki quote). So in other words, we tend to slack off from doing what we know we need to do, knowingly that not doing this will get us in trouble but we still do it. But why is that? Why do we consciously choose to have this lifestyle and sabotage our emotional well being?

I tend to do this a lot. Even though I know that in the past I had this problem and that I have already talked about this - it still gets to me. I need to keep remembering my self because I tend to fall back to the old ways. Yes, I bet I will still at some point start this habit again and I will write about it again just to help my brain develop into new habits. So come with me and explore on what might help you.

### Perfectionist

I found out that being a perfectionist is one of the traits that leads to procrastination. As a perfectionist you don't let yourself make mistakes, you want to make sound effects or music as best as you can in the first go. Maybe you're afraid to make mistakes knowing that you'll feel less motivated to move on. You start to overthink the process, start to get anxious and without even doing nothing physicaly you feel tired and need to relax from what just had happened. Does this sound familiar? We'll maybe your a bit of a perfectionist.

How to overcome being a perfectionist is simple, but it's not easy, it takes work. What could help you is trying to form a mindset to start making mistakes and being okay with it. This will make your brain to think that it is perfectly okay to make mistakes. That no one will hurt you if you do make an error or that it is not sounding as you want. The drum beat isn't that good? Well you have laid a base, tomorrow you can correct the patterns to make it more fluid. The fireball isn't realistic? After resting you'll find yourself how to edit it better. 
Get yourself into a habit that you are constantly making something, it does not have to be perfect or even good, it has to be made. We learn from our mistakes. Making progress and learning will benefit us more than sitting in place and "thinking" how to make the perfect sound, the perfect riff.

### Conclusion

In short - become a percetionist of making mistakes and being okay with it. There is no mastery without failure.
Confucius once said about work what can be mentioned here - *When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, donâ€™t adjust the goals, adjust the action steps.*
