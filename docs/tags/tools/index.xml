      <description>In here I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about how I added an interesting system of wind SFX in Unity by using white noise and Unity&amp;rsquo;s sound mixer effects. I&amp;rsquo;d call this a dynamic wind SFX even. Because right know this is directly linked with the boat&amp;rsquo;s speed velocity. As it goes faster the wind becomes more high pitched and when it is going slower the wind is more on the low-end.
Generated Wind Effect I found this technique in one of Blipsounds video&amp;rsquo;s by Ryan Stunkel.</description>

      <description>Hey there! As the game is open-source all the sfx used in the game are free-to-use. It might be hard a bit to download all the samples from the git directory for some as git and unity file system might not be that easy to use to everyone so I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled all the sounds into a sound pack to download. Also with it, made metadata into the sounds for easier tag searching.</description>

      <description>Hey there! Quick post about the game &amp;ldquo;Neanderthal Tools&amp;rdquo; for which I helped my friend Edvinas with the sounds on his game. Well it has been made public and available to everyone! Was chatting with him a few days ago when he mentioned that he will soon be having a meeting with the museum he has been cooperating. They have already deployed the game at the museum so I assume the majority of talk will be on what went right and wrong, where they could expand etc.</description>

      <description>To get the best results one must be prepared in advanced to be able to get the most out of what he wants to accomplish. So here I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing the process I had with my friend Edvinas who is doing his masters thesis on interactive media in museums. A bit about the thesis is that they are researching on new ways to help museums convey history in modern day and that is by using VR.</description>
