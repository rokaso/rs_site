      <description>Before diving into a project, I believe that a crucial step is to plan the workflow that will guide the entire process. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to develop a structured approach and stick to it. To streamline my work, I&amp;rsquo;ve considered optimizing my use of Reaper and FMOD.
When working with Reaper, I find that naming conventions are crucial for understanding and efficiently handling files after rendering. As for FMOD events, I use a similar naming system to the asset files.</description>

      <description>This year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been neck-deep in two projects, putting in loads of work, and truth be told, it&amp;rsquo;s been so hectic that I&amp;rsquo;ve neglected this blog for quite a while. But hey, better late than never, right?
Let me tell you about one of those projects, ExerGale, a VR game that&amp;rsquo;s all about flying, gliding, and climbing through a fantastic world. Right now, the game offers two modes: one where you can just soar around like a bird, and another where you hit a button and go on a crystal-collecting spree to rack up a high score.</description>
