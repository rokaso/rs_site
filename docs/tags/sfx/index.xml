      <description>The Global Game Jam 2023 took place on February 3-5. As you all know, this event brings together developers, designers, artists, and creative thinkers from around the world to collaborate, share ideas, and build new and innovative games in just one weekend. I attended it in Kaunas, Lithuania which is organized by LŽKA and the website of the event can be found here. This years art was done by an amazing artist - Teresė Žvinakevičiūtė.</description>

      <description>Playing sounds on collision events is probably one of the most used event types in game audio. This can be by dropping an item on the ground, wall, table or bashing the item into other objects for example hitting a sword into a rock.
Preparing the Component In the components tab we add a procedural mesh component by pressing on the Add Component button, scrolling to the rendering section and finding the Procedural Mesh component (or upon pressing just typing the name).</description>

      <title>Random pitch changing for samples in Unity</title>

      <description>Doing sound design you find yourself that you have a good sample to add to the game, but the sample is so good that any other would not fit, but you need more variations so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fatigue the ears but just making a wee bit of pitch shifting and exporting it seems cheesy. Well now, what if we would do that in the game engine itself? Now that would be more stylish, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <title>Generating wind from a noise sample in a game engine</title>

      <description>In here I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about how I added an interesting system of wind SFX in Unity by using white noise and Unity&amp;rsquo;s sound mixer effects. I&amp;rsquo;d call this a dynamic wind SFX even. Because right know this is directly linked with the boat&amp;rsquo;s speed velocity. As it goes faster the wind becomes more high pitched and when it is going slower the wind is more on the low-end.
Generated Wind Effect I found this technique in one of Blipsounds video&amp;rsquo;s by Ryan Stunkel.</description>

      <description>Hey there! As the game is open-source all the sfx used in the game are free-to-use. It might be hard a bit to download all the samples from the git directory for some as git and unity file system might not be that easy to use to everyone so I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled all the sounds into a sound pack to download. Also with it, made metadata into the sounds for easier tag searching.</description>

      <description>To get the best results one must be prepared in advanced to be able to get the most out of what he wants to accomplish. So here I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing the process I had with my friend Edvinas who is doing his masters thesis on interactive media in museums. A bit about the thesis is that they are researching on new ways to help museums convey history in modern day and that is by using VR.</description>
