      <description>Hey there! As the game is open-source all the sfx used in the game are free-to-use. It might be hard a bit to download all the samples from the git directory for some as git and unity file system might not be that easy to use to everyone so I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled all the sounds into a sound pack to download. Also with it, made metadata into the sounds for easier tag searching.</description>

A bit about the thesis is that they are researching on new ways to help museums convey history in modern day and that is by using VR.</description>
