      <description>Working in FMOD is quite a time saver with it&amp;rsquo;s capabilities in playing sounds at a given moment, adding effects based on the event that was sent from a game engine and easily shifting from placeholders to the final product.

      <description>The creative side I love the feeling that a sound can give to people. A wind chime sound that presented on a chest to fulfill a magical note. The hugeness and power that low frequencies portray as well as higher pitched sounds help to show that something is really small and also cute, not dangerous. Other worldly synthesizer sounds that is used in Sci-Fi world building. To me the most powerful tool in sound design is silence.</description>
