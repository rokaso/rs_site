Working in FMOD is quite a time saver with it's capabilities in playing sounds at a given moment, adding effects based on the event that was sent from a game engine and easily shifting from placeholders to the final product. Middleware's like FMOD are used by a lot of audio designers because it is a powerful tool in ones arsenal. And although scripting, coding and programming can sound daunting, with the little help of it and audio designer can do wonders in game development. You don't have to learn all the aspects of a language, just the basic idea to get around. Luckily this is not a post on programming, but getting the project ready to work with.

First of all we will be needing to download [FMOD Studio Suite](https://www.fmod.com/download) and [Unity Integration](https://www.fmod.com/download). We will be using 2.01.05 version as it is Unity verified. Take note that the Unity Integration packet and FMOD Studio Suite must be on the same version.
