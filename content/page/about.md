### The creative side
I'm absolutely enamored with the world of sound – like the moments when a wind chime's melody carries you away or when you feel the power of bass deeply in your bones. There's something about the mix of highs and lows, not to mention those futuristic synthesizer sounds straight out of a sci-fi flick. It's like each sound has its own story to tell, and I'm all ears for it. But you know what really gets me as well? Silence. It's like the calm before the storm, keeping us on the edge of our seats, wondering what's next.

### Hobbies
I'm a bit of a tech geek with a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering. I've always had a knack for building things – from custom guitar pedals or LED displays that dance along with the music to GPS vehicle tracking devices. As much as I love tinkering with gadgets, I've always craved even more creativity in my life. And that's where sound design comes in. It's like finding the missing piece of the puzzle, blending my love for technology with my passion for artistic expression.
