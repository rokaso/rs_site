### Hey there!

As the game is open-source all the sfx used in the game are free-to-use. It might be hard a bit to download all the samples from the git directory for some as [git and unity file system](https://github.com/Edvinas01/neanderthal-tools) might not be that easy to use to everyone so I've compiled all the sounds into a sound pack to download. Also with it, made metadata into the sounds for easier tag searching. 

So you can fire it up into soundly or other software you use for faster searching. I'm not yet that good with metadata, but if you do find that the way I've done it is not really up to standart - I'm always up for some feedback!


Here's the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jrxlOqqQiqvIKp0wH0WxWPN8cj8plNfS/view?usp=sharing) to the sound pack.
