Hey there! Quick post about the game "Neanderthal Tools" for which I helped my friend [Edvinas](https://github.com/Edvinas01) with the sounds on his game. Well it has been made public and available to everyone! Was chatting with him a few days ago when he mentioned that he will soon be having a meeting with the museum he has been cooperating. They have already deployed the game at the museum so I assume the majority of talk will be on what went right and wrong, where they could expand etc. 

I could talk all day about this, but that's not why we're here for, aren't we?

Here is the link to the game - [Neanderthal Tools](https://github.com/Edvinas01/neanderthal-tools).
